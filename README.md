This is a simple one-page site that I will use to highlight my accomplishments and
introduce myself. It is currenlty being hosted using GitHub Pages. You can view the
live version [Here](https://jdhawley.github.io/).

This is based on Chuck Grooms [One Page Portfolio](https://github.com/chuckgroom/onepage-bio). Thanks Chuck for creating such
as awesome template!
