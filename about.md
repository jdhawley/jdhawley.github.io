# About Jonathan

Hi, I'm Jonathan. Welcome to my blog.

I'm a full stack software engineer during the day and spend a lot of time developing web applications in C#.NET, SQL Server, and HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript. You'll probably see some posts on these topics.

I also have other technical interests I'm looking forward to exploring. These currently include Jekyll static sites (you're reading a Jekyll site right now), cloud architecture (AWS/Azure), and automated testing (unit testing, Selenium testing, Postman API testing). You'll probably see some posts on these topics as well.

I also have quite a few other non-computer interests that may earn a post from time to time. Fitness/health, business, and leadership are just a few of these interests that are "top of mind" lately.

Thanks for dropping by! I hope you find the content valuable. If you have any questions or comments, please reach out to me at [contact@jdhawley.com](mailto:contact@jdhawley.com).
